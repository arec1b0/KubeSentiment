- **Comprehensive Benchmarking**: Includes a full suite for performance and cost analysis across different hardware configurations.

## 🏛️ Architecture Overview

The system is designed as a modular, cloud-native application. At its core is the FastAPI service, which serves the sentiment analysis model. This service is containerized and deployed to a Kubernetes cluster, with a surrounding ecosystem for monitoring, security, and traffic management.

## 🏁 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following tools installed on your local machine:

- **Python 3.11+**
- **Docker & Docker Compose**
- **kubectl** (for Kubernetes interaction)
- **Helm 3+** (for Kubernetes package management)
- **make** (optional, for using Makefile shortcuts)

### 1. Local Development (Docker Compose)

This is the quickest way to get the service running on your local machine.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/arec1b0/mlops-sentiment.git
    cd mlops-sentiment
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    make install-dev
    ```

3.  **Start the service:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
    This will build the Docker image and start the FastAPI service.

4.  **Test the service:**
    Open a new terminal and send a prediction request:
    ```bash
    curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/predict" \
         -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
         -d '{"text": "This is an amazing project and the setup was so easy!"}'
    ```

    You should receive a response like:
    ```json
    {
      "text": "This is an amazing project and the setup was so easy!",
      "sentiment": {
        "label": "POSITIVE",
        "score": 0.9998
      }
    }
    ```

### 2. Full Kubernetes Deployment with Monitoring

To experience the full MLOps stack, including the monitoring dashboard, you can deploy the entire system to a Kubernetes cluster (e.g., Minikube, kind, or a cloud provider's cluster).

Our **[Quick Start Guide](docs/setup/QUICKSTART.md)** provides a one-line script to get the application and its full monitoring stack running in minutes.

```bash
# Follow the instructions in the Quick Start guide
./scripts/setup-monitoring.sh
```

This will deploy the application along with Prometheus for metrics, Grafana for dashboards, and Alertmanager for alerts.

## 💻 Usage

### API Endpoints

The service exposes several key endpoints:

| Method | Endpoint              | Description                                      |
|--------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `POST` | `/api/v1/predict`            | Analyzes the sentiment of the input text.        |
| `POST`   | `/api/v1/batch/predict`      | Submits a batch of texts for asynchronous prediction. |
| `GET`    | `/api/v1/batch/status/{job_id}` | Checks the status of a batch prediction job.      |
| `GET`    | `/api/v1/batch/results/{job_id}`| Retrieves the results of a completed batch job. |
| `GET`  | `/api/v1/health`             | Health check endpoint for readiness/liveness.    |
| `GET`  | `/api/v1/metrics`            | Exposes Prometheus metrics.                      |
| `GET`  | `/api/v1/model-info`  | Returns metadata about the loaded ML model.      |

### Configuration

The application is configured via environment variables, which are documented in our **[Deployment Guide](docs/setup/deployment-guide.md)**. For Kubernetes deployments, these are managed via `ConfigMap` and `Secret` objects, which are defined in the Helm chart.

> **Note:** `.env` files are intentionally _not_ baked into the container image. Provide any sensitive or environment-specific settings at runtime using the mechanisms supported by your orchestrator.

#### Supplying configuration at runtime

- **Docker / Docker Compose:** pass variables with `--env-file` or individual `-e` flags when running the container.
- **Kubernetes:** mount configuration with `envFrom` or `env` entries sourced from a `ConfigMap` or `Secret`. Sensitive values (API keys, credentials) should be stored in a `Secret`, while non-sensitive defaults can live in a `ConfigMap`.

Example Kubernetes manifest snippet:

```yaml
envFrom:
  - configMapRef:
      name: mlops-sentiment-config
  - secretRef:
      name: mlops-sentiment-secrets
```

This approach keeps secrets out of the image and allows you to tailor configuration per environment (dev/staging/prod) without rebuilding the container.

## 📊 Benchmarking

A key part of this project is its ability to measure performance and cost-effectiveness. The `benchmarking/` directory contains a powerful suite for running load tests against the service on different hardware configurations.

This allows you to answer questions like:
- "Is a GPU instance more cost-effective than a CPU instance for my workload?"
- "What is the maximum RPS our current configuration can handle?"

The benchmarking scripts generate a comprehensive HTML report with performance comparisons, cost analysis, and resource utilization charts. See the **[Benchmarking README](benchmarking/README.md)** for more details.

### Latest Kafka Consumer Benchmark Snapshot

| Scenario | Batch Size | Messages Processed | Wall Time (s) | Approx. Throughput (msg/s) |
|----------|------------|--------------------|----------------|-----------------------------|
| Synthetic workload executed with the in-repo `MockModel` using the high-throughput Kafka consumer (no external brokers) | 1,000 | 1,000 | 0.0095 | ~105,700 |

> **How it was measured:** `python benchmarking` helper script (see commit history) instantiates `HighThroughputKafkaConsumer` with the same `MockModel` used in the test suite and processes 1,000 synthetic messages in a single batch. This mirrors the high-throughput path without requiring a live Kafka cluster, making it reproducible in constrained environments.

> **Tip:** For end-to-end benchmarks against a running Kafka cluster, use `benchmarking/kafka_performance_test.py`. It exercises producer/consumer I/O, DLQ handling, and Prometheus instrumentation at scale.

## 🔒 Testing & Security

KubeSentiment includes comprehensive testing and security measures to ensure production readiness.

### Testing Strategy

Our testing approach follows the testing pyramid with multiple layers:

- **Unit Tests**: Fast, isolated tests for individual components (85% coverage minimum)
- **Integration Tests**: Validate component interactions and API endpoints
- **Load Tests**: Performance testing with realistic traffic patterns (constant, ramp, spike, wave)
- **Chaos Engineering**: Resilience testing with pod failures and network disruptions

```bash
# Run unit and integration tests
make test

# Run load tests
python benchmarking/load_test.py --url http://localhost:8000 --rps 100 --duration 60

# Run chaos engineering tests
python tests/chaos/chaos_engineering_tests.py --namespace default
```

See **[Testing Guide](docs/TESTING_GUIDE.md)** for comprehensive testing documentation.

### Security

A comprehensive security audit has been performed covering:

- **Container Security**: Non-root user, read-only filesystem, dropped capabilities
- **Kubernetes RBAC**: Least-privilege service accounts and roles
- **Network Policies**: Strict ingress/egress controls
- **Secrets Management**: HashiCorp Vault integration
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Automated Trivy scans in CI/CD

Key security features:
- ✅ Multi-stage Docker builds with minimal attack surface
- ✅ Pod Security Standards enforcement
- ✅ TLS/SSL encryption for all traffic
- ✅ Automated security scanning on every build
- ✅ Secret rotation with 7-day warning threshold

See **[Security Audit Report](docs/SECURITY_AUDIT_REPORT.md)** for detailed findings and recommendations.

### CI/CD Pipeline

Automated testing and security in GitHub Actions:

1. **Code Quality**: Black, isort, ruff, flake8, mypy
2. **Testing**: Unit tests (85% coverage), integration tests
3. **Security Scanning**: Trivy vulnerability scanning (CRITICAL/HIGH)
4. **Build & Deploy**: Multi-stage Docker build with security best practices
