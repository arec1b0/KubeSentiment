# CI/CD Pipeline Fixes - Complete Summary

## Overview

This document outlines all the fixes applied to the CI/CD pipelines to ensure production-ready deployment.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. ✅ Python Version Inconsistency

**Issue**: Dockerfile used Python 3.9 while project configuration required Python 3.11

**Fix**:

- Updated `Dockerfile` from `python:3.9-slim` to `python:3.11-slim`
- Updated CI workflow to use Python 3.11
- Ensures consistency across all environments

**Files Modified**:

- `Dockerfile`
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

---

### 2. ✅ Line Length Configuration Mismatch

**Issue**: CI workflow used `--max-line-length=88` while project configuration specified 100

**Fix**:

- Removed hardcoded line length from flake8 command in CI
- Now respects `.flake8` configuration file (100 characters)
- Ensures consistency with Black and project standards

**Files Modified**:

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

---

### 3. ✅ Missing Staging Environment Configuration

**Issue**: Helm values file for staging environment was missing

**Fix**:

- Created `helm/mlops-sentiment/values-staging.yaml`
- Configured appropriate resources (2 replicas, moderate limits)
- Added staging-specific ingress and monitoring settings
- Included HPA and PDB configurations

**Files Created**:

- `helm/mlops-sentiment/values-staging.yaml`

---

### 4. ✅ Docker Image Tag Extraction Issues

**Issue**: Image tag was not properly extracted and passed to deployment step

**Fix**:

- Added `extract_tag` step to extract clean tag from metadata
- Created proper job outputs: `image_tag` and `image_full`
- Updated deployment to use extracted tags
- Added build args for image metadata (VERSION, REVISION, BUILDTIME)

**Files Modified**:

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

---

### 5. ✅ Missing Helm Installation

**Issue**: Deploy job attempted to use Helm without installing it

**Fix**:

- Added `azure/setup-helm@v3` action with version v3.13.0
- Ensures Helm is available before deployment
- Added proper kubectl setup with cluster-info check

**Files Modified**:

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

---

### 6. ✅ Security Scan Image Reference

**Issue**: Trivy scan used incorrect image reference format

**Fix**:

- Updated to use `image_full` output from build job
- Added separate table format scan for better visibility
- Properly configured SARIF upload for GitHub Security

**Files Modified**:

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

---

### 7. ✅ Redundant Coverage Report

**Issue**: Duplicate coverage report step that re-ran tests

**Fix**:

- Removed redundant pytest coverage step
- Kept single coverage upload to Codecov
- Reduced CI execution time

**Files Modified**:

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

---

### 8. ✅ Requirements Installation

**Issue**: CI installed tools individually instead of using requirements-dev.txt

**Fix**:

- Changed to `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt`
- Ensures all dev dependencies are installed
- Maintains consistency with local development

**Files Modified**:

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

---

## Additional Improvements

### Enhanced Deployment Logic

**What Changed**:

- Added `should_deploy` step with clear conditional logic
- Separate checks for each environment:
  - Development: requires `develop` branch
  - Staging: requires `main` branch
  - Production: requires version tag (`v*`)
- Proper exit handling for skipped deployments

### Improved Health Checks

**What Changed**:

- Added pod readiness wait with 5-minute timeout
- Retry logic for health endpoint checks (5 attempts)
- Fallback to internal health check via exec if no ingress
- Better error messages and diagnostics

### Deployment Summary

**What Changed**:

- Added deployment summary to GitHub Actions summary
- Shows environment, namespace, image, replicas
- Lists all deployed resources
- Improves visibility and debugging

### Better kubectl Configuration

**What Changed**:

- Proper kubeconfig setup in `$HOME/.kube/config`
- Set correct file permissions (600)
- Added cluster-info verification
- Consistent KUBECONFIG usage across steps

## Testing the Fixes

### Local Testing

```bash
# Test code quality
make lint

# Test with pytest
pytest tests/ -v --cov=app

# Test Docker build
docker build -t sentiment-service:test .
```

### CI/CD Testing

1. **Pull Request**: Triggers test and lint jobs only
2. **Push to develop**: Deploys to development environment
3. **Push to main**: Deploys to staging environment
4. **Tag v***: Deploys to production environment

---

## Environment-Specific Configurations

| Environment | Branch/Tag | Namespace | Replicas | Resources |
|-------------|------------|-----------|----------|-----------|
| Development | `develop` | `mlops-sentiment-dev` | 1 | 250m/512Mi |
| Staging | `main` | `mlops-sentiment-staging` | 2 | 500m/1Gi |
| Production | `v*` tags | `mlops-sentiment` | 3 | 1000m/2Gi |

---

## Security Improvements

1. **Trivy Scanning**: Scans for CRITICAL and HIGH severity vulnerabilities
2. **SARIF Upload**: Results uploaded to GitHub Security tab
3. **Table Output**: Additional scan with table format for visibility
4. **Non-blocking**: Security scans don't block deployment but report issues

---

## Monitoring and Observability

### Prometheus Retention

- Development: 7 days
- Staging: 15 days
- Production: 30 days

### AlertManager

- Staging: Slack notifications to `#staging-alerts`
- Production: Slack + Email with severity-based routing
  - Critical: Immediate notification + email to oncall
  - Warning: Slack notification with 24h repeat interval

---

## Next Steps

### Required Secrets Configuration

Ensure these secrets are configured in GitHub repository settings:

```bash
# Repository Secrets (per environment)
KUBE_CONFIG          # Base64-encoded kubeconfig

# Optional but recommended
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL    # Slack webhook for notifications
```

### Setting up Secrets

```bash
# Encode kubeconfig
cat ~/.kube/config | base64 -w 0

# Set in GitHub
gh secret set KUBE_CONFIG -b "BASE64_ENCODED_CONTENT" --env development
gh secret set KUBE_CONFIG -b "BASE64_ENCODED_CONTENT" --env staging
gh secret set KUBE_CONFIG -b "BASE64_ENCODED_CONTENT" --env production
```

### Environment Protection Rules

Configure in GitHub repository settings:

1. **Development**: No restrictions
2. **Staging**: 1 required reviewer
3. **Production**: 2 required reviewers + 5 minute wait timer
