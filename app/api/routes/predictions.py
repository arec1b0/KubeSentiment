Prediction endpoints.

This module provides the primary endpoints for making sentiment analysis
predictions. It includes synchronous and asynchronous endpoints for
single predictions and batch processing.

    """Analyzes the sentiment of a given text.

    This is the primary endpoint for real-time sentiment analysis. It accepts a
    JSON payload with a single text input and returns a prediction of its
    sentiment, including a label (e.g., 'POSITIVE', 'NEGATIVE') and a
    confidence score. The endpoint also provides performance metadata in its
    response headers, such as the inference time and the model backend used.

    Args:
        payload: The request body, which should be a `TextInput` object
            containing the text to be analyzed.
        response: The FastAPI `Response` object, used to set custom headers
            with metadata about the prediction.
        prediction_service: The prediction service, injected as a dependency,
            which encapsulates the business logic for making predictions.
        backend: The name of the model backend in use (e.g., 'pytorch', 'onnx'),
            injected as a dependency.
        settings: The application's configuration settings, injected as a
            dependency.

    Returns:
        A `PredictionResponse` object with the sentiment analysis results,
        including the predicted label and confidence score.

    Raises:
        HTTPException: If the input text is invalid, the model is not loaded,
            or if an unexpected error occurs during the prediction process.
