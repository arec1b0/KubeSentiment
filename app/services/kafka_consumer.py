"""
High-performance Kafka consumer for real-time sentiment analysis.

This module implements a multi-threaded, batch-processing Kafka consumer
designed for high-throughput, low-latency message ingestion and processing.
It features intelligent batching, a dead-letter queue (DLQ) for handling
failed messages, and comprehensive monitoring for production environments.
