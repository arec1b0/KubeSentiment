Asynchronous batch processing service for high-throughput sentiment analysis.

This service provides a robust and scalable solution for processing large
volumes of text data asynchronously. It features a priority-based queueing
system, intelligent batching for efficient model inference, and result
caching to improve performance for repeated requests.
