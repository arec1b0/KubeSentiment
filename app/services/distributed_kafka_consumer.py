"""
Distributed Kafka Consumer Architecture for Horizontal Scaling.

This module provides a distributed Kafka consumer designed for horizontal
scaling in a containerized environment like Kubernetes. It extends the base
Kafka consumer with features for consumer group coordination, automatic
partition rebalancing, and instance health monitoring.
